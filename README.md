## Description
This project is a face detection and censorship application that uses a webcam to detect people's faces and automatically censors them using a pixelation effect. It was built using HTML, JavaScript, and the face-api.js library for the face detection.

## Demo
When loading the application from the browser:
- The webcam feed starts
-  The app will detect any visible face
-  Each face is then automatically censored in real time

## How It Works
The project finds faces using the `tinyFaceDetector` model from the `face-api.js` library and overlays them using pixelation to censor them.
### Main Features:
- Real-time face detection using the webcam
- Pixelation for face censorship effect
- Responsive canvas that syncs with video feedback
- Async and await JavaScript features

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript
- face-api.js
- Parcel bundler (dev/build)
